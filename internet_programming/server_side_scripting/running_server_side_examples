Running CGI-based programs requires three pieces of software:
1. the client, to submit requests: a browser or script - any web browsers can be used as a client (firefox, chrome, internet explorer etc..)
2. the web server that receives the request - the only missing piece; the intermediate web server
3. the CGI script, which is run by the server to process the request - we will write CGI scripts,
urllib.request module can also serve as a web client in scripts

web server options:
- open source Apache system - provides complete, production-grade web server, also has mod_python extension
which runs python scripts quickly.
- access to an account on a web server machine that runs python 3.x (a remote server account)
- running a local web server - our approach - webserver.py

URL format:
